## QREST Goals

The overarching goals of QREST are to:
(1) provide small tribal agencies with the ability to generate legally-defensible air quality data and build tribal capacity
(2) Support tribes with air quality data analysis and reporting by pushing out industry and EPA changes to all participating tribes at once 
(3) enable more valid data availability to EPA and partners

## QREST Features

The primary features of QREST allow users to:
- Use up-to-date codes, guidance, and regulations from EPA, because AQS and other relevant codes and limits can be pushed to QREST users when EPA makes changes
- More quickly conduct the 1st phase of data review, by using functions to automatically flag data using the 3 factors of the initial data review
- Analyze, interpret and present data, using preformatted report and chart templates to aggregate and plot validated data, create reports, and summary statistics
- Fulfill the independent quality assurance function required for regulatory and legally-defensible data, by providing a structure for the two levels of separation required between data gatherer and final data validation as required by CFR and all quality system requirements (ISO). Many tribal agencies consist of one or two people, making this review impossible within the same tribal agency. A structured collaboration with another tribe’s qualified reviewer, with SOPs, documentation), and strict access limitations can be possible for tribal agencies using QREST, thereby enabling more tribes to fill the QA function required for regulatory data;
- Incorporate supporting data into their validation package, by allowing users to set up companion sites and parameters so that the validity of unusual concentrations can be supported by relevant downwind or other data from AirNow or other agency websites, and provide functions that document validity decisions, including importing, plotting, and saving such supporting data in the final data validation record;
- Push data to the Exchange Network (and EPA’s Air Quality Subsystem (AQS) and the EPA’s AirNow).
